# AUTOMORC_Data

In this archive you will find AUTOMORC experiment data. The data was collected while driving a mobile gamma spectroemtry vehicle equipped with 2x 4l NaI   and 123% HPGe detectors past gamma radiation sources of varying activities placed at several distances to the road. Further description of the AUTOMORC experiment and resulting scientific publications are available at:

- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096980432200094X?via%3Dihub#fig5

The data is written in a NBL file format. To decode the data from the NBL format use the ImpNBL R library that I have written:
